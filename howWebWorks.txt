    - The browser will take the URL and convert it into a IP address using DNS.
    - Your browser then makes a request to that IP address to gather the content infotmation such as the HTML/CSS. 
    - The server then responds back to the browser with the information that has been requested. The creating a DOM from the HTML that was requested, also finds any other resources such as any images on the page, or the CSS for the styling, and the JS.
    - For all the other requests a seperate HTTP request is sent to find them.
